## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a front-end developer with a strong focus on performance and accessibility. This space is dedicated to projects, experiments, and learning resources that reflect my commitment to building web experiences that are fast, inclusive, and user-friendly.

Performance and accessibility are at the core of my development philosophy. I believe that a great website isnâ€™t just about how it looksâ€”itâ€™s about how well it performs and how easily people of all abilities can use it. From optimizing loading times and reducing JavaScript bundle sizes to implementing semantic HTML and ARIA roles, I strive to build interfaces that are both efficient and accessible.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find projects that highlight my approach to front-end development using technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and modern frameworks such as React or Vue.js. Many of these projects include performance audits using tools like Lighthouse, as well as accessibility checks with automated testing tools and manual review processes.

Each project is structured with clear documentation, readable code, and an emphasis on best practices. I aim to make these repositories valuable not only for showcasing my work but also as resources for other developers who are passionate about creating high-quality, user-centric websites.

Whether youâ€™re a fellow developer, accessibility advocate, or someone looking to improve your siteâ€™s performance, I hope you find something useful or inspiring here. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, collaboration, and conversations around better ways to build for the web.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to explore the projects, fork the code, or open an issue. Letâ€™s keep pushing the web forwardâ€”one accessible, high-performance interface at a time.
